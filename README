This is a collection of example CMake projects demonstrating different ways of building
and using vendored copy of Boost.

project1 and project2 use ExternalProject to build Boost with b2, then "find" it from
the base project . The same approaches can be used for other 3rd party libraries
which install their CMake integration files.

project3 uses Orphis/boost-cmake (which internally uses FetchContent and builds source
files of Boost as a part of "main" cmake project. See its CMakeLists.txt for more details.

Building
-------
